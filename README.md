# Moe-Pawn
## A highly configurable pawnshop script for QBCore in FiveM, built with Lua.

**You third eye (alt) and look at the npc, and you can interact with the pawnshop.**

**This is the basic menu, if you have the item, the item will show up with a price.**

**If I select thermite, this menu pops up, I can then input how many of the thermite I want to sell**

**Then a nice notification when I've sold it**

## Features:

* You can create multiple pawnshops
* Each Shop can have the same, or different products
* You can change the smallest details, like the icon on the map, or the icon when you third eye the npc
* Set a minimum and maximum price, the price changes every 30 minutes
* All of this can be done only from the config file!
